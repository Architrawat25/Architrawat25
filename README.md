# Hi, I'm Archit Rawat ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for Machine Learning and a drive to innovate. I'm currently specializing in ML and exploring its applications in various domains.

## About Me

* I'm a tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and SQL.
* I'm experienced in Machine Learning, Data Structures, and Algorithms, with a strong focus on problem-solving.
* I'm also familiar with cloud platforms like AWS, containerization using Docker, and building RESTful APIs with FastAPI.

## My Work

* **Machine Learning Projects**: I've worked on several ML projects, including [Real-time Hate Speech Detection](https://github.com/Architrawat25/real-time-hate-speech-detection), [Deep Learning Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Architrawat25/deep-learning-sentiment-analysis), and [Stock Price Prediction using ML](https://github.com/Architrawat25/stock-price-prediction-ML).
* **Data Structures and Algorithms**: I've implemented various data structures and algorithms, including non-linear data structures like graphs, trees, and heaps, which can be found in my [Non-Linear Data Structures](https://github.com/Architrawat25/Non-Linear-Data-Structures) repository. I've also built a [Library Management System](https://github.com/Architrawat25/library-management-system-java) using Java.
* **Competitive Programming**: I'm an active participant on LeetCode, where I solve problems to improve my coding skills and learn from others. You can find my LeetCode profile at [leetcode.com/u/architrawat25/](https://leetcode.com/u/architrawat25/).
